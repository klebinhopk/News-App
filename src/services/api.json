        "description": "A lack of inclusive language and photos of LGBTQ+ couples on social media may indicate that a wedding vendor isn't as accepting as you thought.",
        "content": "Insider spoke to wedding professionals about vendor red flags.SolStock/Getty Images It can be difficult to find LGBTQ+ friendly wedding vendors.  Wedding pros offer Insider tips on what makes for an inclusive vendor — and what are red flags.  Check for LGBTQ+ representation on social media and inclusive language on their websites. Not finding it? That could be a sign. As if wedding planning isn't stressful enough, for LGBTQ+ couples, it can prove extra complicated and emotionally draining. Despite the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015, LGBTQ+ couples still face discrimmination and homophobic language during the wedding planning process, and often from the place you wouldn't expect it: the wedding professionals themselves. Wedding vendors in many areas of the U.S. are overwhelmingly supportive of same-sex couples, but there are other cases that are just the opposite. LGBTQ+ couples still interact with wedding vendors that are just not accepting of couples like them. Insider spoke to Emily Monus, a New York-based wedding planner that specializes in LGBTQ+ weddings, and Kirsten Palladino, the co-founder and creative director of Equally Wed, about what couples should look for when choosing their wedding vendors.The vendor's website and social media fails to show any hint of LGBTQ+ representation When hiring a wedding vendor, Monus recommends scrolling through the company's Instagram page or photos on their website to see examples of their typical clientele. Most wedding professionals post images of their past work and blogs about their now-married couples. Monus explained that a common red flag is the lack of LGBTQ+ couples in the imagery. \"If all I see are cis, heterosexual, white people on someone's profile, this may not be the right vendor,\" Monus said of working with LGBTQ+ couples.Of course, she added, a business may be accepting even if their social media doesn't indicate as such. But an important aspect to the LGBTQ+ community is to make inclusivity a priority. For Palladino, that means posting same-sex couples outside of June, for Pride Month.\"It needs to be consistent, not just popping up in June,\" Palladino said. \"I'm still queer in December. Are you welcoming me into your business at that time?\"Palladino warned against vendors that use stock photos of LGBTQ+ couples instead of real couples from past weddings. Stock images can feel fake whereas actual couples feel more representative of reality, she said.\"Everybody in the queer community has already seen that photo a hundred times,\" she said of stock images, adding that it's important to use \"authentic LGBTQ+ people.\"The language on a vendor's website is exclusiveThe language on a vendor's online platforms will also indicate how inclusive they are, especially when it comes to wedding planning. As both Monus and Palladino pointed out to Insider, much of the language that is traditionally used around weddings is very gendered. Words like \"bride,\" \"groom,\" and \"bridal party\" are all cis and heteronormative. Using them makes members of the LGBTQ+ community feel excluded.\"It's not enough to be friendly when somebody walks through your door; you also need to use the language that resonates with them,\" Palladino said of why the language matters. To help vendors better understand LGBTQ+ couples, she created a glossary of inclusive language for Equally Wed.The language on a vendor's site should be inclusive.franckreporter/Getty ImagesSee what language a wedding business uses, Palladino said. For example, if your only option on an inquiry or intake form is to list the names of a \"bride\" and \"groom,\" it may indicate a company isn't used to working with queer couples.Look instead for vendors that use words like \"partners,\" \"couple,\" and \"wedding party.\" That goes for pronouns too. If a vendor doesn't ask about your preferred pronouns, it may indicated they are not as familiar with non-cis-gendered couples.Monus and Palladino recommend that all vendors transition to using the word \"marriers\" instead of bride or groom, as it's a more inclusive term for engaged couples, even if they are heterosexual. \"If you can be inclusive, why wouldn't you be?\" Monus said. \"It just makes things better for everybody.\"There are overtly religious or anti-gay statements on a vendor's website or social mediaMonus said she is not against religion, but she has correllated overtly religious messaging on a vendor's website and social media with a red flag for LGBTQ+ couples. \"Overly religious statements sometimes put me off because so much of the hate that LGBTQ people receive is from conservative [religious groups],\" Monus said.Specifically, statements that present marriage as a union only between a man and a woman would be a signal a same-sex couple may not want to work with a vendor, Monus told Insider.\"Wedding vendors say things like, 'the bond between a man and a woman is sacred,'\" she said. \"Any language where it's exclusively saying 'between men and women', I immediately would be turned off.\"The key is to look for vendors that make you feel comfortableBoth Monus and Palladino recommend surrounding yourself with wedding vendors who make you feel seen and heard.\"If you're a queer couple and seeing the same language over and over again, you start to feel defeated, like this isn't for me,\" Monus said. \"It's supposed to be fun and exciting.\"Palladino also advised to look for vendors who go the extra mile when it comes to inclusivity, such as ensuring a venue has a gender-neutral bathroom or an emcee who doesn't address your guests as \"ladies and gentlemen,\" no matter how your guests identify.\"Even if no one in the LGBTQ+ community is coming to your wedding, every inclusive action that you take has a ripple effect on our community,\" Palladino said, to which Monus added: \"We fought really hard to get to this place, and it's important that we make everyone feel included.\"Read the original article on Insider",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 — Umno MP Datuk Seri Nazri Abdul Aziz has today admitted that he was among those who signed a statutory declaration (SD) to support PKR President Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to become the prime minister in 2020. English daily The Star reported that the Padang Rengas MP said he signed the SD to save Umno, claiming that former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had planned to dissolve the Malay nationalist party. \"I was the Barisan National secretary-general, so I wanted to save Umno. One of the ways is, I called Anwar because the agreement was for Dr Mahathir to be the prime minister for two years before he passed the baton to Anwar. \"So I went to see Anwar, I told him ‘Datuk Seri, when you become prime minister, don't dissolve Umno’. He said: Nazri ‘Umno is Pak Ibrahim’s party, so I won’t dissolve Umno’,” he was quoted as saying, referring to Anwar's father. He further clarified that not all Umno lawmakers signed the SD, and he had tried to convince his colleagues to do the same. \"However, not every leader agreed to sign the SD. There were only four or five of us who signed the SD. \"We signed the SD to save Umno, so it is true but in the end, Dr Mahathir didn't give the position to Anwar so the SD expired,\" he added, referring to Anwar succeeding Dr Mahathir as prime minister. Earlier, Tajuddin had in a press conference alleged that 15 Umno MPs had signed the SD to support Anwar including himself. He alleged that the list of the 15 MPs who had signed the SDs at the Tamu Hotel in Kampung Baru here included Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Pekan MP Datuk Seri Najib Razak, and Padang Rengas MP Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz. Nazri has since admitted to signing the SD. Tajuddin also alleged a movement to topple Zahid from his post as Umno president back in May 2020. The PH administration fell in February 2020 after former ally Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia had joined forces with Umno and PAS to form the Perikatan Nasional government. It was previously reported in December 2020 that at least 10 Umno MPs had signed the SD and Anwar was ready to show that he had the command of the majority of Parliament to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, but nothing came out of it.",

        "content": "Photo: Yahoo News   The wife of Venezuela’s opposition leader met at the White House on Thursday with President Joe Biden, after he declined to invite him to an Américas summit. By Yahoo News Jun 23, 2022 Fabiana Rosales, the wife of Juan Guaido, posted pictures of herself meeting both Biden and First Lady Jill Biden and said she “spoke out for all Venezuelans.” She spoke to the Bidens about “the defense of human rights, protection of migrants, freedom for political prisoners and the need to hold a free and fair election in Venezuela,” said a statement from her office. Jill Biden on Twitter called Rosales “a courageous First Lady and mother fighting for a better future for all Venezuelans.” The invitation came two weeks after President Biden welcomed the hemisphere’s leaders to Los Angeles for the Summit of the Américas but did not invite Guaido, although he spoke to him by telephone. The United States considers Guaido to be the interim president of Venezuela after Nicolás Maduro was declared the winner of a 2019 election marred by widespread allegations of irregularities. But Maduro has managed to hold on to power even with a collapsing economy that has caused millions to flee Venezuela. The United States has faced rising calls in the region to change a strategy set by former president Donald Trump that sought to topple Maduro through sweeping sanctions. The White House said it did not invite Guaido as it wanted to encourage a resumption of dialogue between the opposition and Maduro. … Read More: Yahoo News – Venezuela opposition wife at White House after summit sidelining … La Patilla in English",

        "content": "WWE has introduced an interesting yet strange internal memo cataloging the superstars that are allowed to have a haircut during TV tapings. Being a professional wrestler for an acclaimed company like the WWE means living on the edge. From owning certain superstars’ ring names to haircuts, WWE has the authority to change and develop their characters. WWE recently issued a memo listing the names of superstars from both Raw and Smackdown brands that are allowed to get a haircut during TV tapings. According to Fightful Select (H/T Wrestling Inc.), the list goes as follows: Superstars from Raw on the approved list: AJ Styles, Bobby Lashley, Cody Rhodes, Damien Priest, Dolph Ziggler, Edge, Finn Balor, Kevin Owens, The Miz, Randy Orton, Riddle, and Seth Rollins. Superstars from Smackdown on the approved list: Drew McIntyre, Happy Corbin, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Kofi Kingston, Madcap Moss, Paul Heyman, Ricochet, Roman Reigns, Sami Zayn, and Xavier Woods. The haircut policy is already in effect as certain superstars were groomed accordingly. Notably, Edge and Becky Lynch. The night after defeating AJ Styles at Wrestlemania Backlash, Edge was seen with a new haircut that was shorter than before. Similarly, WWE did something interesting with Becky’s hair. Becky was involved in a storyline with Bianca Belair where she would get her hair cut off by Belair during a scuffle. That gave Becky a new look and a loss at Wrestlemania 38 against Bianca Belair. According to Fightful’s report, Although Austin Theory’s name is not listed, he’s been seen getting different haircuts from time to time. An amusing fact It’s funny how bald superstars like Bobby Lashley and Ricochet also made the list. There is no doubt that they don’t have any hair, so what is their name on the list for? Facial hair maybe? Or just regular grooming. The other superstars whose names aren’t on the list may have to get their hair styled by external barbers.

        "content": "Draymond Green rips Kendrick Perkins for openly admitting that he wished for LeBron James to suffer an ACL injury heading into Game 7 of the 2008 Finals. LeBron James in his first stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers was a different breed of player. From 2003-2009, the 6-foot-9 forward averaged a staggering 27.8 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1.7 steals per game. Bron was so incredibly talented that in the first 7 years with the Cavs, he had 6 All-Star selections, 6 All-NBA selections, and 2 MVPs, among a whole other bunch of accolades in his cabinet. The younger version of The King was a freak of nature. LBJ was so far superior from the remaining players of the game that his opponents would literally wish for him to suffer a horrific injury rather than face him. Recently, Kendrick Perkins openly admitted how he hoped that James would sustain an ACL injury before the Cavs and Celtics met in Game 7 of the 2008 NBA Finals. Perks stated on JJ Redick’s “The Old Man and the Three” podcast: “I ain’t going to lie, man, I was scared as hell going into that Game 7 against LeBron James. This was the only time that I actually prayed that something happened to him at practice. … I was like, ‘Let us get breaking news that LeBron tore his ACL or something. I did, bro, I’m not even lying. I’m not even exaggerating. You can’t edit this out, this is real! That’s how terrified I was of LeBron.” “I kept saying to myself, ‘Man, we ain’t getting past this mother[expletive]. He coming in here and he’s going to beat us. I was like, ‘This is just a different dude right now.’ I was scared.” Also Read: Draymond Green blasts the analyst amidst a turmoil of vitriol amongst journalists and players “Stop making a fool of yourself”: Draymond Green on Kendrick Perkins’ comments GSW star Draymond Green absolutely ripped into the analyst for his questionable confession. On the recent episode of his “Draymond Green Show”, the 4-time NBA Champ attacked the former Cs big man: “Are you kidding me? You actually thought that was OK to admit? Come on, cuz. You can’t think that’s OK to admit. Even if you felt that way—which, by the way, why do you feel that way? That’s a problem. But even if you feel that way, take that to the grave, my man.” “There was once a point in time where ACLs was ending people’s careers. You remember this is how we feed our families?” Green said. “We always talk—I don’t know if you do, because it’s not much substance—we always talk about, when you get hurt, you leave the court, you live that. You don’t leave the court and it’s like, ‘All right, I’m not hurt anymore, I can walk now. But when the game’s going on, when practice is going on, I’m back on crutches.’ Like it’s a video game. No, you really live this stuff.” “So, for you to pray on another man’s downfall, that’s a character flaw, my man. If you pray on somebody’s downfall once, you’re gonna pray on it again. That’s a little wack to me. That’s not new media. I don’t understand. You don’t have to go on TV and go act like that, brother. You played. Act like it. Stop doing this. Stop making a fool of yourself.” To be fair, even though the comments were made out of respect for LeBron’s dominance, we have to agree with Dray here. Seems rather cruel to admit that you had prayed for a fellow player to sustain a career-ending injury.

        "description": "GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64 is one of those games that will forever be held up as a milestone in the art. It wasn’t the first FPS on a console, or even the first FPS on the Nintendo 64, but it was unquestionably the best. And the most influential. GoldenEye 007 inspired the development of Half-Life and reportedly prompted the creation of the Medal of Honor series. It also holds very fond memories for everyone of a certain age who would hunch over someone’s 14-inch bedroom TV to play the local deathmatch for hours at a time.Its success, and legacy, means it’s one of a handful of titles that would merit a feature-length making-of documentary. Drew Roller’s GoldenEra tries to encompass everything about the title, from its genesis as a small project at Rare’s rural farmland campus to the monster it became. In one way, the story of GoldenEye 007 mirrors that of Citizen Kane – created by neophytes so unaware of what would be achieved, they went on to break new ground in the process. And while many of the team would go on to make some pretty good games, nothing would come close to their debut in terms of impact and acclaim.GoldenEra has been able to get many of the original team on the record, including David Doak, Karl Hilton, Brett Jones, Duncan Botwood and Steve Ellis. Their testimony is supplemented by a number of journalists and talking heads from across the games industry that helps bulk out the gaps. After all, Rare (then working in partnership with Nintendo, now owned by Microsoft) has always been more secretive about what it does than other studios. And so there do seem to be missing chunks of testimony that would have helped paint a richer, fuller picture here.And if there’s a problem with the film, it’s that it’s a lot harder to make the drama compelling given that software design is relatively staid. Not to mention that the impact a game has has to be measured in different ways to, for instance, a movie or album. After all, you can fairly clearly spot the examples of pop phenomenons, since they often swallow the culture around them for weeks or months at a time. Our relationship with video games is often a lot more personal, beyond the usual visual cues of people queuing up to buy the title on release day.This is, perhaps, where GoldenEra starts to feel a little saggy, since it tries to cover the breadth of GoldenEye 007’s fallout without much depth. This means that the back third essentially becomes a series of five minute segments covering Perfect Dark, Free Radical Design and Timesplitters, GoldenEye fan films, the modding community that have kept the title alive and what happened to Rare. There’s even a little detail about the proposed remake of GoldenEye 007, as well as plenty of snark handed out to the subsequent James Bond games that are all, universally, not very good. But as much as you or I might take issue with the scattershot approach, it’s one way of folding in all of the many and varied ends to this particular story.GoldenEra is available to rent or buy today on a number of on-demand platforms, including Google Play, Prime Video, Apple TV and Sky in the UK. There is no news, yet, on when the film will be made available in the US.",

        "description": "Катар ще бъде домакин на непреки преговори между Иран и Съединените щати през следващите дни, съобщава \"Ройтерс\". Новината идва на фона на натиск от страна на Европейския съюз да се излезе от продължаваща с месеци безизходица в преговорите за възстановяване на т.нар. иранска ядрена сделка от 2015 г. В Иран избрахме Катар за домакин на преговорите, защото е наш приятел, заяви Мохамад Маранди, медиен съветник на главния ирански преговарящ по ядрените въпроси. През март ядрената сделка изглеждаше близо до възобновяване, когато ЕС, който координира преговорите, покани във Виена външните министри на страните по споразумението за финализиране на споразумението след 11 месеца непреки преговори между Техеран и Вашингтон. Оттогава насам обаче преговорите бяха прекратени, най-вече поради настояването на Иран САЩ да премахнат Корпуса на гвардейците на Ислямската революция от списъка си на чуждестранните терористични организации. Споразумението от 2015 г. направи по-трудно за Техеран разработването на материали за ядрени оръжия. То обаче се разпадна, след като президентът Доналд Тръмп изтегли Съединените щати от него през 2018 г. Върховният представител на ЕС за външната политика Жозеп Борел, който миналата седмица беше на посещение в Техеран, обяви, че се очаква непреките преговори да се възобновят през следващите дни в страна от Персийския залив.",

        "description": "El cuidado de las uñas es crucial para manos y pies impecables La entrada Manos a las uñas se publicó primero en Últimas Noticias.",
        "content": "Sus uñas son el reflejo de su personalidad y pueden constituir su mejor tarjeta de presentación, pero el color no lo es todo para la belleza de las manos y de los pies: lucir una manicura y pedicura inmaculada implica cuidarlos a diario. Exfoliar e hidratar son los pilares básicos, aunque también resulta importante aplicar mascarillas nutrientes semanales y, de vez en cuando, baños de parafina. Mientras que la manicura resulta imprescindible hacerla una vez a la semana, la pedicura es cada quince días. No se debe olvidar que las cutículas no se cortan. Los pies necesitan un cuidado especial durante todo el año. Los pies sufren heridas, callos y demás adversidades debido al uso de un calzado inadecuado, el calor y las rozaduras. Por ello, se debe acudir al menos una vez al año al podólogo para que vele por la salud de los pies, retire las durezas y estudie si existen hongos en las uñas, una enfermedad muy habitual. “La onicomicosis o infección por hongos en las uñas es un problema más frecuente de lo que imaginamos y para muchas personas es una enfermedad muy embarazosa que puede causar un verdadero impacto en la calidad de vida del afectado”, explica la experta en belleza estética Felicidad Carrera. Es más frecuente en las uñas de los pies por sus condiciones habituales de humedad que facilitan el crecimiento de los hongos. “El uso frecuente de piscinas, saunas o gimnasios, calzado que no permite la correcta transpiración, enfermedades como la diabetes, insuficiencia renal o tratamientos inmunosupresores (quimioterapia), entre otras causas son los culpables de que aparezcan los hongos”, explica la especialista en microbiología Pilar Peña. El tratamiento tradicional suele basarse en el uso de anti fúngicos tópicos y si no hubiera éxito se puede pasar al tratamiento oral. “Pero el periodo de tratamiento es muy largo, puede durar hasta 6 meses y suele fracasar en un gran porcentaje de los casos, entre otras causas por la aparición de efectos secundarios como molestias gastrointestinales, hepatotoxicidad o rash cutáneos”, dice la dermatóloga María Segurado. MANICURA EN CASA • Elimina los restos de laca de uñas con un disolvente sin acetona. • Luego, lava inmediatamente las manos para que el disolvente no quede demasiado tiempo en contacto con las uñas, porque tiende a resecarse. • Introduce después las manos durante unos minutos en un bol con agua templada y jabón. • Retira las pieles muertas alrededor de las uñas. • Una vez que te hayas secado las manos aplica un baño de aceite de oliva templado, que nutre y refuerza la keratina de las uñas. • Pasa un pulidor sobre las uñas. Además de borrar las estrías, el pulidor de uñas proporciona brillo. • Para limarte las uñas, comienza desde un lado de la uña hacia el centro y siempre en la misma dirección para evitar que se desdoblan. Evita las limas de metal, pues tienen tendencia a romper las uñas. • Aplica después una crema hidratante y masajea suavemente tus dedos y tus uñas. • Si utilizas laca de uñas con color, aplica una base protectora antes para no manchar tus uñas. DE ACERO • Si tus uñas son frágiles o se rompen fácilmente, evita llevarlas largas. • Córtalas en forma recta bastante cortas. • Masajearlas todas las noches con una crema especial para uñas o con un poco de aceite de oliva, para evitar que se desdoblen. • Una carencia en la alimentación puede influir en el estado de las uñas. Para evitarlo, haz una cura con levadura de cerveza. También puedes consumir soja, mariscos o pescado. • Para que las uñas estén siempre en buen estado, ocúpate a menudo de las cutículas. Esas pequeñas pieles que protegen la base de las uñas se rompen fácilmente. Después de masajear las uñas con una crema especial, retirarlas hacia atrás con ayuda de un bastoncillo o de un palito retira cutículas. • Utiliza cuidados específicos para proteger tus uñas. Para uñas blandas, utiliza un cuidado fortificante y endurecedor, y cuida las uñas que se rompen con un endurecedor; para uñas secas, es preferible utilizar una laca de uñas nutritiva. • La aplicación de la laca de uñas puede ser puramente estético, pero también sirve para resolver pequeños problemas de firmeza; por ejemplo, existen lacas de uñas con keratina, endurecedoras, que impiden que las uñas se rompan. • No te muerdas las uñas, si es el caso, aplica una laca especial con sabor amargo. • Procura lavarte las manos con agua fría. • Evita cortar las uñas, es preferible limarlas. • Utiliza siempre una base protectora bajo una laca con color. • Utiliza guantes para las tareas de la casa y del jardín.
